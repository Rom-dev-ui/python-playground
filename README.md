# Python Playground

Welcome to the **Python Playground** repository! This is a collection of small Python scripts and functions designed to help you explore and experiment with different concepts in Python programming.

## Overview

The `main.py` file serves as the main entry point to test and run various Python functions, algorithms, and features. This playground is perfect for experimenting with code snippets, learning new techniques, and testing your ideas in Python.

## Features

### Functions Included in `main.py`:

1. **`hello_world()`**: 
   - A simple function that prints "Hello, World!" to demonstrate basic Python syntax.
   
2. **`fibonacci(n)`**: 
   - Generates the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. This is a common algorithm often used to practice recursion or loops.

3. **`prime_numbers(limit)`**: 
   - Returns a list of prime numbers up to a given limit. It demonstrates basic iteration and condition checking in Python.

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-playground.git
     ```

2. **Run `main.py`**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned and run `main.py` using Python:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

   - You will see the output for the `hello_world()`, `fibonacci()`, and `prime_numbers()` functions printed to the console.

3. **Experiment**:
   - Feel free to modify the existing functions or add new ones to experiment with Python. This repository is meant to be a place for testing and learning.
